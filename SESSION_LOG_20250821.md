# Session Log - August 21, 2025
## PDH/PDL Bootstrap Issue Investigation & Fix

### SESSION METADATA
- **Date**: August 21, 2025
- **Start Time**: Approximately 10:27 AM
- **Duration**: ~1.5 hours
- **Location**: C:\Users\salte\ClaudeProjects\github-repos\TSX-Trading-Bot-V5
- **Primary Issue**: PDH/PDL strategy not using historical data for bootstrap

---

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The PDH/PDL (Previous Day High/Low) strategy in TSX Trading Bot V5 was not properly initializing on startup. Instead of using historical data to calculate PDH/PDL values, it was waiting for live candles to accumulate, causing hours of delay before becoming operational.

---

## FILES CREATED/MODIFIED

### 1. Strategy Files Modified
```
src/strategies/PDHPDLStrategy-Comprehensive.js (103,569 bytes)
  - Added calculatePDHPDLFromHistoricalBars() method
  - Modified initializeWithHistoricalData() to process bars before truncation
  - Added bootstrapped flag to PDH/PDL state
  - Backup created: PDHPDLStrategy-Comprehensive.js.backup (97,842 bytes)

src/strategies/PDHPDLStrategy-Comprehensive-FIXED.js (21,522 bytes) [NEW]
  - Complete rewrite for architectural compliance
  - Removed all direct HTTP calls
  - Uses Redis pub/sub through bot reference
  - Implements requestHistoricalDataThroughBot() method
  - Adds processHistoricalDataResponse() handler
```

### 2. Connection Manager Modified
```
connection-manager/core/ConnectionManager.js (210,622 bytes)
  - Added REQUEST_HISTORICAL_DATA case in handleConnectionManagerRequest()
  - Lines 1260-1265: New handler for historical data requests
```

### 3. Test Scripts Created
```
test-pdh-bootstrap.js (4,440 bytes)
  - Tests PDH/PDL bootstrap mechanism
  - Verifies strategy initialization with historical data

test-connection-manager-historical.js (7,208 bytes)
  - Tests Connection Manager's ability to retrieve historical data
  - Checks available endpoints

test-redis-historical-request.js (7,273 bytes)
  - Tests historical data request through Redis channels
  - Monitors response channels

test-redis-channels.js (5,761 bytes)
  - Monitors active Redis pub/sub channels
  - Tests channel communication

test-historical-proper-channel.js (8,194 bytes)
  - Tests proper Redis channel for historical requests
  - Uses correct message format

test-direct-cm-request.js (2,334 bytes)
  - Direct test of connection-manager:requests channel
  - Debug tool for EventBroadcaster
```

## KEY DISCOVERIES

### 1. Architecture Violation
**FOUND**: Line 419 in original PDHPDLStrategy-Comprehensive.js
```javascript
const req = http.request(options, (res) => {  // VIOLATION!
```
Strategy was making direct HTTP calls to `localhost:7500/api/History/retrieveBars`

**CORRECT FLOW**:
```
Strategy ‚Üí Bot ‚Üí Aggregator ‚Üí Connection Manager ‚Üí TSX API
        ‚Üñ___________________________________________‚Üô
                  (All via Redis pub/sub)
```

### 2. Bootstrap Logic Flaw
**FOUND**: Line 637-649 in getRTHCandlesFromPreviousDay()
```javascript
// Comment admits: "For now, use the most recent RTH candles"
const recentRthCandles = rthCandles.slice(-78);
```
Not actually getting previous day's data, just recent candles from memory

### 3. Missing Handler
**FOUND**: ConnectionManager.handleConnectionManagerRequest() had no case for REQUEST_HISTORICAL_DATA
- Only handled: GET_POSITIONS, UPDATE_SLTP, CLOSE_POSITION, GET_ACCOUNTS

---

## FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### Fix 1: Calculate PDH/PDL from Historical Bars
```javascript
calculatePDHPDLFromHistoricalBars(bars) {
    // Groups bars by trading day
    // Finds most recent complete RTH trading day
    // Calculates PDH/PDL before array truncation
    // Returns values with success flag
}
```

### Fix 2: Proper Redis Communication
```javascript
async requestHistoricalDataThroughBot() {
    // Uses mainBot.aggregatorClient
    // Publishes to proper Redis channels
    // No direct HTTP calls
}
```

### Fix 3: Connection Manager Handler
```javascript
case 'REQUEST_HISTORICAL_DATA':
    const historicalRequest = data.payload || data;
    console.log(`üìä Forwarding historical data request`);
    await this.handleHistoricalDataRequest(historicalRequest);
    break;
```

## TESTING PERFORMED

### Test 1: Connection Manager Availability
- ‚úÖ Connection Manager running on port 7500
- ‚úÖ Health endpoint accessible
- ‚ùå /api/History/retrieveBars not exposed (correct - should use Redis)

### Test 2: Redis Channel Communication
- ‚úÖ Redis running and accessible
- ‚úÖ Channels subscribed: connection-manager:requests, instance:control
- ‚ùå EventBroadcaster not processing messages (remaining issue)

### Test 3: Historical Data Flow
- ‚úÖ Request published to Redis channels
- ‚úÖ Connection Manager receives subscription
- ‚ùå No response received (EventBroadcaster issue)

---

## REMAINING ISSUES

1. **EventBroadcaster Message Processing**
   - Subscribed to channels but not processing messages
   - May be Redis client configuration issue

2. **Response Channel Wiring**
   - Historical data responses need to flow back to bot
   - Bot needs handler for HISTORICAL_DATA_RESPONSE

3. **Full Integration**
   - Need all services running together
   - Complete Redis ‚Üí Aggregator ‚Üí Connection Manager chain

---

## COMMANDS EXECUTED (Key Examples)

```bash
# Started Connection Manager
cd TSX-Trading-Bot-V5 && node connection-manager/index.js

# Tested historical data request
node test-pdh-bootstrap.js

# Monitored Redis channels
node test-redis-channels.js

# Checked running services
tasklist | grep -E "(redis|node)"

# Created backups
cp PDHPDLStrategy-Comprehensive.js PDHPDLStrategy-Comprehensive.js.backup
```

## VERIFICATION CHECKSUMS

```
PDHPDLStrategy-Comprehensive.js: Size 103,569 bytes
PDHPDLStrategy-Comprehensive-FIXED.js: Size 21,522 bytes
ConnectionManager.js: Size 210,622 bytes (modified)
```

## SESSION OUTCOME

### ‚úÖ Successful
1. Identified root cause of PDH/PDL bootstrap issue
2. Fixed architectural violation (direct HTTP calls)
3. Implemented proper historical data calculation
4. Added missing Connection Manager handler

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial
1. Redis pub/sub chain not fully operational
2. EventBroadcaster needs debugging
3. End-to-end testing pending

### üìù Next Steps
1. Debug EventBroadcaster Redis subscription
2. Wire up response handlers in TradingBot.js
3. Test full data flow with all services
4. Verify PDH/PDL bootstrap works end-to-end
