# Agent Activity Log - August 19, 2025

## Session Overview
**Time**: 18:15 - 18:30
**Primary Agent**: Direct Claude Code (No agent framework active)
**Task**: Debug and fix trade metrics integration

## Activities Performed

### [18:15:00] Direct Investigation - Trade Metrics Flow
- Traced data flow from BOT_1 through aggregator to Connection Manager
- Identified response channel mismatch issue
- Found bot publishes to `statistics:response:{requestId}` channel

### [18:20:00] Direct Fix - Logging Verbosity
- Fixed bot crashes due to excessive market data logging
- Reduced logging to 0.5-1% sampling rate
- Simplified bot-launcher.js rate limiting

### [18:25:00] Direct Investigation - Statistics API
- Added debug logging to RedisAdapter for statistics requests
- Verified Connection Manager has handleGetStatisticsRequest method
- Confirmed authentication module provides proper headers

## Key Findings

1. **Statistics Request Path**:
   - Bot creates unique response channel: `statistics:response:{requestId}`
   - Aggregator RedisAdapter stores this channel for response forwarding
   - Connection Manager should receive and process the request

2. **Potential Issues**:
   - Request might not be reaching Connection Manager
   - TopStepX API authentication might be failing silently
   - Response forwarding through RedisAdapter needs verification

## Recommendations for Next Session

1. Monitor aggregator console output for GET_STATISTICS debug messages
2. Verify Connection Manager is receiving requests from aggregator
3. Check TopStepX API authentication status
4. Test with curl and monitor Redis channels directly

## Files Modified
- AggregatorClient.js - Logging reduction
- TradingBot.js - Logging reduction  
- bot-launcher.js - Rate limiting fixes
- RedisAdapter.js - Statistics debug logging

## Status
- Bot stability: âœ… FIXED
- Statistics integration: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS (needs aggregator log verification)
