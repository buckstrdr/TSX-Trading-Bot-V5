# Daily Log - August 19, 2025

## Session Summary
**Date**: 2025-08-19
**Project**: TSX-Trading-Bot-V5
**Focus**: Trade Metrics Integration & Bot Stability Fixes

## Issues Identified

### 1. Bot Crashing Due to Verbose Logging
**Problem**: BOT_1 was crashing due to excessive market data logging (100-200 messages/second)
**Status**: âœ… FIXED

### 2. Trade Metrics Integration Issues
**Problem**: Statistics requests from BOT_1 not reaching TopStepX API through the aggregator chain
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

## Changes Made

### Logging Improvements (COMPLETED)
1. **AggregatorClient.js**
   - Reduced market data logging to 0.5-1% sampling rate
   - Removed verbose quote/trade processing logs
   - Added sampling for error messages

2. **TradingBot.js**
   - Reduced unexpected market data warnings to 1% sampling
   - Reduced error logging to 10% sampling

3. **bot-launcher.js**
   - Simplified console rate limiting
   - Added filtering for market data messages
   - Removed FileLogger dependency that was causing crashes

### Statistics Flow Debugging (IN PROGRESS)
1. **RedisAdapter.js**
   - Added debug logging for GET_STATISTICS request storage
   - Added debug logging for statistics response forwarding
   - Confirmed request storage and response forwarding logic

## Current Data Flow for Statistics

```
1. BOT_1 â†’ /api/statistics endpoint called
2. Bot publishes GET_STATISTICS to 'aggregator:requests' âœ…
3. RedisAdapter stores pending request with response channel âœ…
4. Connection Manager receives request (NEEDS VERIFICATION)
5. Connection Manager calls TopStepX userapi /Statistics/todaystats
6. Connection Manager publishes response to 'connection-manager:response'
7. RedisAdapter forwards to bot's response channel
8. Bot receives statistics or times out (Currently timing out)
```

## Issue Analysis

### Root Cause (Still Investigating)
The statistics request flow appears correct but responses are not reaching the bot. Possible issues:
1. Connection Manager may not be receiving the request from aggregator
2. TopStepX API authentication might be failing
3. Response channel routing might have a mismatch

### Debug Points Added
- RedisAdapter: Logs when storing GET_STATISTICS requests
- RedisAdapter: Logs when forwarding statistics responses
- Connection Manager: Already has logging for statistics requests

## Next Steps

1. **Check Aggregator Console Output**
   - Need to verify if aggregator is receiving and forwarding GET_STATISTICS requests
   - Check if Connection Manager is processing the requests

2. **Verify Authentication**
   - Ensure Connection Manager has valid auth token for TopStepX API
   - Check if statistics endpoint is returning data or errors

3. **Test End-to-End Flow**
   - Use curl to test /api/statistics on BOT_1
   - Monitor Redis channels for message flow
   - Check all service logs for the request lifecycle

## Files Modified

- `src/core/trading/AggregatorClient.js` - Reduced logging verbosity
- `src/core/trading/TradingBot.js` - Reduced market data logging
- `src/core/trading/bot-launcher.js` - Simplified rate limiting, removed FileLogger
- `src/core/aggregator/adapters/RedisAdapter.js` - Added statistics debug logging

## Service Status
- âœ… BOT_1: Running stable after logging fixes
- âœ… Trading Aggregator: Restarted with new logging
- âœ… Connection Manager: Running
- âœ… Redis: Running

## Notes for Next Session
- Aggregator was restarted after adding debug logging
- Need to test statistics endpoint and check aggregator console for debug messages
- The statistics response format is already defined in bot-launcher.js (lines 542-555)
- Authentication module is located at: `shared/modules/auth/authentication.js`
